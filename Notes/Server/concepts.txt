ðŸ’¡ Think of your .NET web app like a restaurant:
âœ¨ app.UseRouting â†’ sets up the menu system, so the restaurant knows what dishes (routes) to serve.

âœ¨ app.UseHttpsRedirection() â†’ politely tells customers to use the secure entrance (HTTPS) instead of the regular door (HTTP).

ðŸ§µ Why your app works without them:
You're using minimal APIs, like this:

app.MapGet("/weatherforecast", ...);
Minimal APIs are like a tiny restaurant that:

Only serves one dish (a single route). Already knows where the kitchen is.

Doesnâ€™t need a menu or redirection to work.

So even without:


// app.UseRouting();
// app.UseHttpsRedirection();
ðŸ‘‰ It still serves that one dish (/weatherforecast) just fine!

âœ… When you'll need those lines?
If later you build something bigger like:

app.UseRouting();
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => {
    endpoints.MapControllers();
});

or use MVC/Controllers â€” then routing becomes essential!
